# BBC Micro Save N Load
### This program set (of two) can read and write DATA stored in memory to a file stored on the BBC micro's disk filesystem.

#### The `.ssd` in the latest release contains both the Read and Write programs along with a test file, named TRIAL1.
#### Both Read and Write programs can also be found in the source.txt.

### Information about and around this program can be found on the Wiki - https://github.com/d1ddle/BBCMicro-SaveNLoad/wiki

#### Both these programs have been improved upon from the demo in the "Guide to Programming on the BBC Micro" Book, published in 1985.
#### Unlike the program in the book, you don't need to pre-input the length of your DATA, as BBC Micro Save N Load uses an error handler to determine when the input Data has run out.

### To use the technology in your own programs, change the filename at the top of both the read and write programs, and change/add DATA input/s in the write program.

#### I can see this file read/write system being used in gamesaves, document editors and so much more.
#### I'm aware that this kind of thing already exists, but I felt like separating it from a different program I'm working on, just for ease of use when using it in another.

##### Previously known as:
##### - BBC Micro Data Read Write
##### - BBC Micro File Read Write
